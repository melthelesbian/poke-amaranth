# CREDITS

I couldn't have made this hack without the help of [Luna](https://github.com/JustRegularLuna), who helped me one way or another with nearly everything, and whose hacks provided the code for many of the cool features I ~~shamelessly stole~~ adapted. Additionally, it would be similarly impossible to do this without the creators and contributors to the [RGBDS](https://rgbds.gbdev.io/) toolchain and [pret](PRET.md) disassembly projects. I'd also like to acknowledge and thank Rangi42, who created [Polished Map](https://github.com/Rangi42/polished-map), [Tilemap Studio](https://github.com/Rangi42/tilemap-studio), and the wonderful and helpful community on the [Polished Crystal](https://github.com/Rangi42/polishedcrystal) discord server. These credits will probably always be incomplete, but I will attempt to provide more detailed, specific credits below.
